<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Sahan Cooray</h1>

---

I'm a second-year Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa, driven by a passion to blend healthcare with innovation. My key interests include myoelectric prosthetics, EMG-based projects, human-computer interaction (HCI), and 3D-printed medical assistive devices. I specialize in designing custom prosthetics and orthoses using Geomagic Freeform Plus with a haptic device, allowing for precise, patient-specific modeling.

As the COO and Director of Rysera Innovations (Pvt) Ltd, a multidisciplinary engineering startup founded by UoM undergraduates, I lead our Biomedical division. Under my guidance, we’ve launched a new initiative to provide affordable, personalized prosthetics, orthoses and medical assistive devices to underserved communities in Sri Lanka. By collaborating closely with occupational therapists, we aim to deliver meaningful, low-cost assistive solutions and empower people with physical challenges across the country. My mission is to bridge the gap between advanced biomedical technology and the real-world needs of patients.
